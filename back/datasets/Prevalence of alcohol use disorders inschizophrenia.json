Previous systematicreviews have found a wide range (12\u201355%) ofAUD prevalence in patients with schizophrenia (1,2). Previous studies published between the years1960 and 1989 were reviewed by Mueser et al. (1)and those from the years 1990\u20132001 by Cantor-Graae et al. (2). Both reviews presented resultsKoskinen J, Lo\u00a8ho\u00a8nen J, Koponen H, Isohanni M, Miettunen J.Prevalence of alcohol use disorders in schizophrenia \u2013 a systematicreview and meta-analysis.Objective:Our aim was to present recent studies of alcohol usedisorders (AUDs) in patients with schizophrenia, estimate overallprevalence and characteristicsa\ufb00ecting the prevalence of AUDs.Method:We conducted a search using three literature databases and amanual search on articles published in 1996\u20132008. Meta-regression wasused to study how prevalence is a\ufb00ected by di\ufb00erent studycharacteristics. Articles that reported diagnoses according to DSM orICD diagnostic systems were included.Results:Altogether 60 studies met our criteria. The median of currentAUD prevalence was 9.4% (inter-quartile range, IQR 4.6\u201319.0, 18studies) and median oflifetime AUD prevalence 20.6% (IQR 12.0\u201334.5, 47 studies). In studies using DSM-III-R median prevalence washigher than that in studies using DSM-IV, ICD-9 or ICD-10(32\u204417\u204411\u20446%).Conclusion:Approximately every \ufb01fth patient with schizophrenia hadlifetime AUD diagnosis. When contrasted with the most recent review,there might be a descending trend in AUD prevalence in patients withschizophrenia.J. Koskinen1, J. L\u00e7h\u00e7nen1,H. Koponen2,3, M. Isohanni1,J.

However,it remains unclear how these factors a\ufb00ect preva-lence and what is the overall estimate of AUDprevalence in patients with schizophrenia.There are several reasons why it is important tostudy AUD in patients with schizophrenia. There isstrong evidence that comorbid AUD worsensclinical outcomes in patients with schizophrenia:they have more psychotic symptoms and moresevere depressive symptoms (3, 4); poorer treat-ment compliance; increased somatic morbidity;risk of violence, criminality and suicides; morenegative psychosocial events, e.g. divorce andunemployment; more admissions and longer hos-pitalization periods; taken together, in addition toadding to individual/C213s su\ufb00ering, they also increasethe costs of the treatment (5\u20137). Although there aretwo previous systematic reviews considering AUDin patients with schizophrenia, a meta-analysis onthis topic has not yet been conducted.", "Aims of the study", "i) systematically collect and review studies pub-lished in 1996\u20132008 on AUD in patients withschizophrenia and contrast the prevalence ofAUDs in previous reviews;ii) estimate the overall prevalence of AUD inpatients with schizophrenia;iii) \ufb01nd out how study design and sample charac-teristics affect prevalence of AUD in patientswith schizophrenia.", "Material and methods", "In order to \ufb01nd articles reporting the prevalence ofAUD in patients with schizophrenia publishedin 1996\u20132008 as extensively as possible, weconducted a search using three electronic databases(PsycINFO, PubMed and Web of Science).

At the same time a similar searchwas performed for cannabis use disorders. Alto-gether 3323 articles were found, of which 611articles were evaluated in detail after analysing theabstracts.In addition, we performed a manual literaturesearch for the same time period from the journalsActa Psychiatria Scandinavica,American Journal ofPsychiatry,Archives of General Psychiatry,Brit-ish Journal of Psychiatry,Journal of ClinicalPsychiatry,Psychiatry Research,SchizophreniaBulletin,Schizophrenia ResearchandSocialPsychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology. Thesejournals were selected because they had published aconsiderable proportion of the articles included(approximately 40%) on this topic based on oursystematic database search. We contacted approx-imately 30 authors to receive unpublished data.The inclusion criteria for study collection werethat the study reported information on the prev-alence of alcohol abuse\u2044dependence, the sampleconsisted (at least 80%) of individuals with schizo-phrenia spectrum diagnosis (schizophrenia, schizo-phreniform disorder, schizoa\ufb00ective disorder anddelusional disorder) or articles reported the prev-alence rates by diagnostic group (in samples thatwere less than 80% schizophrenia spectrum), thesubjects were older than 16 years of age and thestudy sample was larger than 15. Only articlesreporting schizophrenia spectrum disorders andAUD diagnoses according to DSM (Diagnosticand Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders byAmerican Psychiatry Association) or ICD (Inter-national Classi\ufb01cation of Diseases by WorldHealth Organisation) diagnostic system criteriawere included. We excluded studies with samplesthat might have biased the presented prevalences ofAUDs in the study, e.g. samples recruited fromprisons, forensic psychiatry units or shelters for thehomeless. Trials and intervention studies were alsoexcluded. Only articles written in English wereincluded.We collected information on the diagnosticsystem used. In our article, the terminology ofAUDs is adopted from the DSM diagnostic system(abuse and dependence). We compared whether thediagnostic system (ICD-9, ICD-10, DSM-III-R orDSM-IV) had an e\ufb00ect on the presented preva-lences. For schizophrenia, the criteria di\ufb00er mainlyin terms of the duration of psychotic symptoms: inICD the symptoms should last 1 month and inDSM 6 months before making the diagnosis.We compared prevalences between \ufb01rst-episodeand long-term patient samples. The average dura-tion of illness was determined from the studies; theminimum reported average duration was 9 years.All these studies were categorized as long-termpatient samples. In addition, we determined thestudy location and whether the sample consisted of", "in- or out-patients.

Whenevidence is found of heterogeneity in the prevalenceestimates between studies, metaregression withz-test can be used to analyse associations betweenprevalences and study characteristics (8).Metaregression was used to compare the e\ufb00ect ofdiagnostic systems (DSM vs. ICD), study setting(\ufb01rst episode vs. long-term sample, in-patients vs.out-patients) and location (North America vs.Europe) with prevalence estimates. Both genderdistribution (proportion of male patients) andmean age were studied as continuous variables.For reasons of presentation these were categorizedinto three groups.

Subjectsin clinical studies of shizophrenia are unlikely to berepresentative of all patients with schizophrenia;therefore, the prevalence estimate presented in thismeta-analysis concern mainly patients under treat-ment. In our results, the prevalence of mediancurrent alcohol abuse was 5% and that of depen-dence 11%. The lifetime prevalences were some-what higher: 14% for lifetime abuse and 19%for dependence. Some original studies reportedmarkably higher lifetime dependence than abuseprevalences (24, 25, 30). In two (24, 25) of thesethree studies, the prevalence estimates of abuse anddependence are not overlapping. This couldexplain the higher prevalence of dependence,which after all is more severe diagnosis. Otheroriginal studies reporting both lifetime abuse anddependence prevalences do not show substantialdi\ufb00erences in prevalences either way.To compare our results with that of previousstudies, we pooled the prevalences of AUDsreported in reviews published by Mueser et al.

This changemay mainly be due to variation in diagnostics,sampling and other methodological di\ufb00erences, butit may also indicate a descending trend in AUDs inpatients with schizophrenia. Nowadays specialtreatment strategies including combination treat-ment and comprehensive care have been developedfor patients with schizophrenia with comorbidAUD. Although clinicians are trained to recognizedual diagnosis patients, underdiagnosing of AUDstill undoubtedly exists (5, 69, 70). In the majorityof studies included in our sample, the AUDdiagnoses were ascertained from several sourcessuch as structured or semi-structured interviews,hospital charts, case notes and registers. Only intwo studies (31, 57) the alcohol use diagnosis wasbased only on clinical diagnosis.To avoid bias, we excluded studies presentingresults from samples recruited from prisons, forensicpsychiatry units or shelters for the homeless. In thesesamples, substance use disorders tend to be signi-\ufb01cantly more common than that in the generalpopulation (5, 71, 72). Our prevalence estimates maytherefore underestimate the actual prevalence, asthese patient samples are not present in our sample.", "Diagnostics", "In DSM-III-R alcohol dependence diagnosisincludes both physiological symptoms, andbehavioural symptoms, whereas alcohol abusediagnosis is a residual category for diagnosingthose who do not meet the criteria for dependence,but who drink despite alcohol-related physical,social, psychological or occupational problems, orwho drink in dangerous situations. In the DSM-IValcohol abuse criteria also included drinkingdespite recurrent social, interpersonal and legalproblems as a result of alcohol use and the criteriafor dependence became stricter. DSM-III andICD-9 di\ufb00er greatly, whereas DSM-IV and ICD-10 have been developed into more compatiblesystems, although di\ufb00erences still exist. ICD-10does not di\ufb00er much in terms of dependencediagnosis from DSM-IV diagnostics. Alcohol usethat causes either physical or mental damage in theabsence of dependence is categorized in ICD-10 asharmful. This category highlights the somaticproblems related to alcohol use more than DSM-IV/C213s abuse diagnosis. These medical conditionsusually appear in older age, which may lead tounderdiagnosing in younger populations in thecase of ICD-10 (73, 74).In our data, the studies using DSM-III-Rdiagnostic system reported higher estimates thanthose studies using DSM-IV, ICD-9 or ICD-10.These di\ufb00erences remained after taking intoaccount other study characteristics (e.g. mean ageand gender distribution). Similar results have beenreported before: in previous studies comparingAUD diagnostics in DSM-III-R, DSM-IV andICD-10 it has been presented that dependencediagnosis is most common in studies using DSM-III-R (75\u201377). Previous study has shown that thediagnosis of ICD-10/C213s harmful use is not ascommon as abuse diagnoses in DSM systems(78), which are seen in our results as well.In our results, the prevalence of alcohol abuseand alcohol dependence was rather similar. There-fore, we combined these diagnoses when studyingcovariates. Many original studies have alsoreported their results combined (see Table 1).In our data set, there are 26 studies reportingresults from schizophrenia samples with narrowdiagnostic criteria and 21 studies were fromschizophrenia spectrum samples with broadercriteria. These di\ufb00erences in diagnostic criteriaare not likely to a\ufb00ect our \ufb01ndings greatly. Onlyone study compared the prevalence of AUDs inpatients with schizophrenia and schizoa\ufb00ectivedisorder. Mueser et al. (53) studied the prevalenceof lifetime alcohol abuse or dependence in an in-patient setting. They reported that patients withschizoa\ufb00ective disorder had 1.4 times more oftendual diagnosis.", "Location of the study", "The substance use pro\ufb01le is greatly a\ufb00ected bycultural factors. Unfortunately, there were only afew non-Western studies in our data set andtherefore we were only able to compare NorthAmerican and (western) European studies. Therewere no di\ufb00erences in AUD prevalence betweenNorth American and European samples.In our sample, there was only one case\u2013controlstudy reporting the results of AUDs in in- and out-patients with schizophrenia compared with thoseon the general population written by the Scottishcomorbidity study group (48). They found out thatAUDs were somewhat more common in patientswith schizophrenia (current abuse 16\u20449%, currentdependence 7\u20443%, lifetime abuse 39\u204434% andlifetime dependence 19\u20448%).We compared AUD prevalence in patients withschizophrenia with alcohol consumption in thecountries in question reported by WHO (79).

However, therewere some exceptions: e.g. in the UK alcoholconsumption was high but the prevalence of AUDin patients with schizophrenia was low, whereas inSweden alcohol consumption was low in generalbut AUD prevalence in patients with schizophre-nia was high. However, alcohol consumption isnot directly proportional to AUD diagnoses andconsumption patterns are strongly associated withculture, which makes this kind of comparisonchallenging.", "Study setting and patient characteristics", "In our data, the di\ufb00erences between in- and out-patients were not statistically signi\ufb01cant. Only inone original study, the prevalences between in- andout-patients were compared. In an Australianstudy by Dawe et al. (20), 57% of in-patients and46% of out-patients had AUD.There were seven studies reporting currentAUD prevalence in long-term patient samples.The duration of illness varied between 7 and33 years. Current AUD prevalence was presentedin four studies from \ufb01rst-episode samples. Wefound no di\ufb00erences in current AUD prevalencesbetween \ufb01rst-episode and long-term patient sam-ples. As expected in long-term patients, thelifetime AUD prevalence was somewhat higher.In our sample, there were only a few studiescomparing mean age between the AUD and non-AUD group. Therefore, we compared thereported mean age between the studies, which isnot a very e\ufb03cient method to study the possiblee\ufb00ect of age. A better way to study the e\ufb00ects ofage on the prevalence of AUDs in patients withschizophrenia would be to compare results pre-sented in each study per individual age group(80). However, in lifetime AUD diagnoses, theprevalence was higher in older patient samples asexpected.In long-term samples of patients with schizo-phrenia, discrepant \ufb01ndings have been reported.Deshmukh et al. (25) found the AUD group to besomewhat younger (mean age 42.4\u204446.9 years),whereas Modestin and his study group (51) foundthat comorbid AUD in-patients were older thanpatients without any substance use disorder.Dawe et al. (20) reported that the \ufb01rst-episodepatients with AUD were younger (mean age23.4\u204427.5 years).Among patients with schizophrenia, AUDs arereported to be more common in male patients (5).In our data set, the gender proportion did not showa signi\ufb01cant di\ufb00erence, although our method wasnot very e\ufb03cient for studying gender di\ufb00erences.There were some studies presenting results onprevalences in male and female patients. Rabino-witz et al. reported gender di\ufb00erences in Israeli (57)and American (58) samples. In these studies,AUDs were two to four times more common inmale patients with schizophrenia. De Lisi et al. (21)reported that AUD was seven times more commonin male patients with schizophrenia in Costa Ricanand US samples.Strengths of the study", "This is a comprehensive systematic review of recentstudies presenting results on AUDs in patients withschizophrenia. This is also the \ufb01rst meta-analysis onthis topic. Our data are collected from a long timeperiod (1996\u20132008) and thus it was possible toinclude a large number of studies (n= 60) that metthe inclusion criteria. There was a wide variety ofmethods and results, and this heterogeneity made itchallenging to pool the results. There are certainchallenges such as inherent biases and di\ufb00erences instudy designs when conducting meta-analyses onobservational studies. We used the recommenda-tions of Meta-analysis of Observational Studies inEpidemiology (MOOSE) (81) as guidelines whenconducting this study. Speci\ufb01c inclusion criteria canbe used to exclude studies with methodologicalproblems. For instance, in the current study weincluded only articles using DSM or ICD diagnosticsystems. Only articles reporting results ondiagnoses based on the criteria of ICD-9, ICD-10,DSM-III-R or DSM-IV diagnostic systems (both inschizophrenia and in AUDs) were included. Inthe majority of the studies the diagnoses of schizo-phrenia and AUDs were ascertained from severalsources.", "Weaknesses of the study", "We conducted a systematic database search andextensive manual search from several scienti\ufb01cjournals. In addition, we contacted several authorsto receive unpublished data. However, it is possiblethat some studies presenting results on the preva-lences of AUDs in patients with schizophrenia aremissing. We may have missed, e.g. studies whereAUD is not the main interest of the article.We used metaregression to examine the e\ufb00ect ofstudy characteristics on the prevalence of AUDs.Because of possible di\ufb00erences in other studycharacteristics metaregression is not a very e\ufb03cientmethod.

Another limitationis that prevalence estimates presented here aremainly from samples from Western countries.Because of limited resources we were able to includeonly articles published in English. Withoutlanguage limitations perhaps a more comprehen-sive view on global AUD prevalence estimates inpatients with schizophrenia could be achieved.In conclusion, our results suggest that AUDs inpatients with schizophrenia are common; however,there might be a descending trend.
